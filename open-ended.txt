question-one: Draw or describe the Linux architecture layers (hardware → kernel → shell → user space). Where do system calls fit?
User Space: Applications (e.g., Python scripts, web servers)
Shell: Command-line interface (e.g., Bash,Dash)
System Call: a way for a program to ask the kernel to do a function 
Kernel: Core of OS (process, memory, device management)
Hardware: CPU, RAM, GPIO, sensors, etc

question-two: Explain the purpose of these directories: /, /bin, /sbin, /usr, /etc, /var.
"/": the root directory and all other directories branch from here.
"/bin": stores essential command-line programs needed for basic system operation.
"/sbin": contains system administration commands used by root or sudo.
"/user": A secondary directory tree for read-only user data like "application files" for the OS and Contains most non-essential (but still important) commands, libraries, and docs.
"/etc": stores system-wide configuration files.
"/var": holds files that change during system operation ("variable" data).

question-three: Why does Linux treat everything as a file? Explain the difference between a program and a process.
To provide a uniform interface to interact with almost all resources using file operations.
the process is a running program while the program is just a code that didn't run yet
